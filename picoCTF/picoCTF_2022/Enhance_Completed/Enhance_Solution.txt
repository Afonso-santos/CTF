1.
 If we open the photo file with vscode we can see the  clue of the flag 
or
 cat drawing.flag.svg on terminal 

2.
 we can see the line of flag ends in  </tspan> 
 cat drawing.flag.svg |grep "</tspan" 

3.
 We can already caught the flag but if we want the flag without the "<",">"," " and "\n". We can write 

cat drawing.flag.svg |grep "</tspan" |cut -d ">" -f2|cut -d "<" -f1|tr -d "\n"|tr -d  " "
