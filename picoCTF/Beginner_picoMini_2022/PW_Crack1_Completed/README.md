## Solution:
  1. Download password cheker and encrypted flag. The files need to stay in the same directory.  
  ```
    $ wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/52/level1.py
    $ wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/52/level1.flag.txt.enc
  ```
  2. If we start the password cheker it will ask one password but we don't have password.
  
  3. I start to read the code and find the correct password.
